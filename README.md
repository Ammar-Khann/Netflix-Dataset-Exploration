# Netflix-Dataset-Exploration
This project explores a Netflix dataset to uncover key insights about content trends, genres, ratings, and release patterns. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer questions like:  What are the most common genres on Netflix?  How has the content library grown over time?
